# Arch-Install-Speedrun
A guide/guidlines for Arch installation speedrunning

## 1 - Basic Explaination 
Installing arch can be a pain for many people, but many people also tend to enjoy creating a challenge out of this; which is one of the reasons Arch is o popular (you can brag about how hard it is to install, and you did it.)
In this guide I will go over the basic guidlines and versions of the speedrun.

### 1.1 - RULES
- NO SCRIPTS ALLOWED (such as archinstall, or any custom-made scripts to auto-input commands)
- NO CHEATING (phony commands, speeding up the video, etc.)

And that's about it, as long as you conform to the %s that follow.

### 1.2 - Versions
